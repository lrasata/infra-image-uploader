# Image uploader infrastructure - managed with Terraform on AWS

> Status : under construction ðŸš§

## TODO

- [ ] Set up AWS event bridge + virus scan
- [ ] Set up the other lambdas
- [ ] The frontend (which is actually the Cloudfront distribution) should provide a  `x-custom-auth` and only treated by the lambda only if correct (same as for the locations API) (how do you link this with existing infrastructure ?) --> look at the python code to know how to upload this. ideally the name of the file should not cause any issue

- [ ] Actually you should be using S3 transfer acceleration feature Enabled because wherever the user might be in the world vs eu-central-1, this data upload performance can be really bad. But how does that work with the presigned url ? because there is a specific endpoint to use s3-accelerate...com to use
